# sudoku-uwp
A three person group project created in C#.
The application was required to use randomly generated boards and was to be a professional looking sudoku game.
The application passed certifaction for the windows store, but was not published.<br/>
I worked primarily on the grid.xaml.cs file<br/><br/>
Currently all of the code in that file was done by me with the EXCEPTION of<br/>

* Conflict, RowCheck2, ColumnCheck2, and SquareCheck2 methods which were copy pasted from the Board class with minor format changes<br/>
* button_Click method<br/>
* Anything timer related<br/><br/>
